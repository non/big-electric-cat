This project is named after
[The Big Electric Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Electric_Cat),
a public access computer system in New York City which itself was
named after
[Adrian Belew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Belew)'s song of
the same name.

### Overview

This library is intended to support using the
[Cats](http://github.com/non/cats) library with the
[Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) data processing system.  Currently
it defines a few type class instances, and contains tests to ensure
that Cats' type classes serialize correctly in Spark.

### Getting Started

This project is unreleased, and the Cats project is only avaiable as a
snapshot. You will need to build this yourself using
[sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Setup.html)
installed. The current interesting targets are:

 * `compile`: compile the code
 * `test`: run the tests (will use a local instance of Spark)
